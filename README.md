1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python mini_rss_reader.py

## Dependencies

- **PyQt5**: Provides the core Qt widgets and classes.
- **PyQtWebEngine**: Required for displaying web content within the application (`QWebEngineView`).
- **feedparser**: Used for parsing RSS feed data.
- **omdbapi**: Used for fetching movie data from the OMDb API.

## OMDb API Key (Optional)

To enable the movie data fetching feature, you need to obtain an API key from [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

- **How to Get an API Key**:
  1. Go to the [OMDb API website](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
  2. Choose a plan (the free plan works for basic usage).
  3. Sign up with your email address to receive the API key.

- **Setting the API Key**:
  - Open the application.
  - Go to **File** > **Settings**.
  - Enter your API key in the **OMDb API Key** field.
  - Click **Save**.

**Note**: If no API key is provided, the application will function without fetching movie data, and ratings will be displayed as "N/A".


## ðŸ“„ JSON Files

The application utilizes two primary JSON files to manage and persist data:

### 1. `feeds.json`

- **Purpose:**  
  Stores all subscribed RSS feeds, including their titles, URLs, and fetched entries.

- **Location:**  
  Located in the application's working directory (same folder as the main script).

- **Structure:**  
  ```json
  [
      {
          "title": "Feed Title",
          "url": "https://example.com/rss",
          "entries": [
              {
                  "title": "Article Title",
                  "link": "https://example.com/article",
                  "published": "2024-04-01T10:00:00Z",
                  "summary": "Brief summary of the article."
              }
              // More entries...
          ]
      }
      // More feeds...
  ]

### 2. `movie_data_cache.json`

- **Purpose:**
  Caches movie-related data fetched from the OMDb API to optimize performance and reduce redundant API calls.

- **Location:**
  Located in the application's working directory (same folder as the main script).

- **Structure:**
  ```json
  {
      "Inception": {
          "Title": "Inception",
